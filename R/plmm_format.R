#' PLMM format: a function to format the output of a model constructed with \code{plmm_fit}
#'
#' @param fit A list of parameters describing the output of a model constructed with \code{plmm_fit}
#' @param std_X_details A list with 3 items: 
#'  * 'center': the centering values for the columns of `X` 
#'  * 'scale': the scaling values for the non-singular columns of `X` 
#'  * 'ns': indicies of nonsingular columns in `std_X`
#' @param fbm_flag Logical: is the corresponding design matrix filebacked? Passed from `plmm()`. 
#' @param snp_names A vector of names for features, passed internally if such names are included with the data `X` passed to `plmm()`
#' 
#' @returns A list with the components: 
#'  * `beta_vals`: the matrix of estimated coefficients on the original scale. Rows are predictors, columns are values of `lambda`
#'  * `rotated_scale_beta_vals`: the matrix of estimated coefficients on the ~rotated~ scale. This is the scale on which the model was fit. 
#'  * `lambda`: a numeric vector of the lasso tuning parameter values used in model fitting. 
#'  * `eta`: a number (double) between 0 and 1 representing the estimated proportion of the variance in the outcome attributable to population/correlation structure.
#'  * `s`: a vectof of the eigenvalues of relatedness matrix `K`; see `relatedness_mat()` for details.
#'  * `U`: a matrix of the eigenvalues of relatedness matrix `K`
#'  * `rot_y`: the vector of outcome values on the rotated scale. This is the scale on which the model was fit. 
#'  * `linear.predictors`: the matrix resulting from the product of `stdrot_X` and the estimated coefficients on the ~rotated~ scale.
#'  * `penalty`: character string indicating the penalty with which the model was fit (e.g., 'MCP')
#'  * `gamma`: numeric value indicating the tuning parameter used for the SCAD or lasso penalties was used. Not relevant for lasso models.
#'  * `alpha`: numeric value indicating the elastic net tuning parameter. 
#'  * `convex.min`: NULL (This is an option we will add in the future!)
#'  * `loss`: vector with the numeric values of the loss at each value of `lambda` (calculated on the ~rotated~ scale)
#'  * `penalty.factor`: vector of indicators corresponding to each predictor, where 1 = predictor was penalized. 
#'  * `ns_idx`: vector with the indicies of predictors which were constant features (i.e., had no variation).
#'  * `p`: the number of features 
#'  * `n`: the number of observations (instances)
#'  * `iter`: numeric vector with the number of iterations needed in model fitting for each value of `lambda`
#'  * `converged`: vector of logical values indicating whether the model fitting converged at each value of `lambda`
