#' Read in processed data
#' This function is intended to be called after either `process_plink()` or `process_delim()` has been called once.
#'
#' @param path The file path to the RDS object containing the processed data. Do not add the '.rds' extension to the path.
#' @param returnX Logical: Should the design matrix be returned as a numeric matrix that will be stored in memory. By default, this will be FALSE.
#' @param trace Logical: Should trace messages be shown? Default is TRUE.
#'
#' @returns A list with these components:
#'  * std_X, the column-standardized design matrix as either (1) a numeric matrix or (2) a filebacked matrix (FBM). See `bigstatsr::FBM()` and `bigsnpr::bigSnp-class` documentation for details.
#'  * (if PLINK data) fam, a data frame containing the pedigree information (like a .fam file in PLINK)
#'  * (if PLINK data) map, a data frame containing the feature information (like a .bim file in PLINK)
#'  * ns: A vector indicating the which columns of X contain nonsingular features (i.e., features with variance != 0.
#'  * center: A vector of values for centering each column in X
#'  * scale: A vector of values for scaling each column in X
