#' Fit a linear mixed model via penalized maximum likelihood.
#' @param design                  The first argument must be one of three things:
#'                                  (1) `plmm_design` object (as created by `create_design()`)
#'                                  (2) a string with the file path to a design object (the file path must end in '.rds')
#'                                  (3) a `matrix` or `data.frame` object representing the design matrix of interest
#' @param y                       Optional: In the case where `design` is a `matrix` or `data.frame`, the user must also supply
#'                                a numeric outcome vector as the `y` argument. In this case, `design` and `y` will be passed
#'                                internally to `create_design(X = design, y = y)`.
#' @param K                       Similarity matrix used to rotate the data. This should either be:
#'                                  (1) a known matrix that reflects the covariance of y,
#'                                  (2) an estimate (Default is \eqn{\frac{1}{p}(XX^T)}), or
#'                                  (3) a list with components 's' and 'U', as returned by a previous `plmm()` model fit on the same data.
#' @param diag_K                  Logical: should K be a diagonal matrix? This would reflect observations that are unrelated, or that can be treated as unrelated. Defaults to FALSE.
#'                                Note: plmm() does not check to see if a matrix is diagonal. If you want to use a diagonal K matrix, you must set diag_K = TRUE.
#' @param eta_star                Optional argument to input a specific eta term rather than estimate it from the data. If K is a known covariance matrix that is full rank, this should be 1.
#' @param penalty                 The penalty to be applied to the model. Either "lasso" (the default), "SCAD", or "MCP".
#' @param init                    Initial values for coefficients. Default is 0 for all columns of X.
#' @param gamma                   The tuning parameter of the MCP/SCAD penalty (see details). Default is 3 for MCP and 3.7 for SCAD.
#' @param alpha                   Tuning parameter for the Mnet estimator which controls the relative contributions from the MCP/SCAD penalty and the ridge, or L2 penalty. alpha=1 is equivalent to MCP/SCAD penalty, while alpha=0 would be equivalent to ridge regression. However, alpha=0 is not supported; alpha may be arbitrarily small, but not exactly 0.
#' @param lambda_min              The smallest value for lambda, as a fraction of lambda.max. Default is .001 if the number of observations is larger than the number of covariates and .05 otherwise.
#' @param nlambda                 Length of the sequence of lambda. Default is 100.
#' @param lambda                  A user-specified sequence of lambda values. By default, a sequence of values of length nlambda is computed, equally spaced on the log scale.
#' @param eps                     Convergence threshold. The algorithm iterates until the RMSD for the change in linear predictors for each coefficient is less than eps. Default is \code{1e-4}.
#' @param max_iter                Maximum number of iterations (total across entire path). Default is 10000.
#' @param warn                    Return warning messages for failures to converge and model saturation? Default is TRUE.
#' @param trace                   If set to TRUE, inform the user of progress by announcing the beginning of each step of the modeling process. Default is FALSE.
#' @param save_rds                Optional: if a filepath and name *without* the '.rds' suffix is specified (e.g., `save_rds = "~/dir/my_results"`), then the model results are saved to the provided location (e.g., "~/dir/my_results.rds").
#'                                Accompanying the RDS file is a log file for documentation, e.g., "~/dir/my_results.log".
#'                                Defaults to NULL, which does not save any RDS or log files.
#' @param return_fit              Optional: a logical value indicating whether the fitted model should be returned as a `plmm` object in the current (assumed interactive) session.
#'                                Defaults to TRUE.
#' @param ...                     Additional optional arguments to `plmm_checks()`
#'

#'  * beta_vals: The matrix of estimated coefficients. Rows are predictors (with the first row being the intercept), and columns are values of `lambda`.

#'                  - X_rownames: A character vector with the row names of all features in the original design matrix; if none were provided, these are named 'row1', 'row2', etc.
#'                  - std_X_colnames: A subset of X_colnames representing only nonsingular columns (i.e., the columns indexed by 'ns')
#'                  - std_X_rownames: A subset of X_rownames representing rows that passed QC filtering & and are represented in both the genotype and phenotype data sets (this only applies to PLINK data)
#'  * std_X: If design matrix is filebacked, the descriptor for the filebacked data is returned using \code{bigmemory::describe()}. If the the data were stored in-memory, nothing is returned (std_X is NULL).
#'  * y: The outcome vector used in model fitting.
#'  * p: The total number of columns in the design matrix (including any singular columns, excluding the intercept).
#'  * plink_flag: Logical - did the data come from PLINK files?

#'  * iter: An integer vector with the number of iterations needed in model fitting for each value of `lambda`
#'  * converged: A vector of logical values indicating whether the model fitting converged at each value of `lambda`
#'  * K: a list with 2 elements, `s` and `U` ---
#'    - s: a vector of the eigenvalues of the relatedness matrix K (note: K is the kinship matrix for genetic/genomic data; see the article on notation for details)
