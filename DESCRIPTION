Description: Fit a penalized linear mixed model that corrects for unobserved confounding. penalizedLMM infers and corrects for the presence of unobserved confounding effects such as population stratification and environmental heterogeneity. It then fits a linear model via lasso penalized maximum likelihood. Originally designed for the multivariate analysis of SNP data, penalizedLMM eliminates the need for LD pruning and subpopulation-specific analyses. Functions for the appropriate processing of PLINK files are also supplied.
