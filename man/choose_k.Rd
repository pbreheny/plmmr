\title{a function to choose k, the number of eigenvalues to use in truncated eigendecomposition}
\usage{
choose_k(
  X,
  eta,
  start = NULL,
  step = NULL,
  eps = 0.1,
  trace = TRUE,
  type = "F",
  returnKapprox = TRUE,
  returnK = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{can be either:
\itemize{
\item the fully-imputed design matrix, or
\item a string specifying the path to an .rds object created by process_plink
}}

\item{eta}{A value between 0 and 1 representing the proportion of variation attributable to population structure. See \code{estimate_eta()}.}

\item{start}{The starting number of eigenvalues. Defaults to floor(nrow(X)/10)}

\item{step}{The size (with respect to the number of observations) of the increments of increase in choosing k. Defaults to floor(nrow(X)/10).}

\item{eps}{A percentage indicating the largest permissible approximation error between the true and approximate relatedness matrices. Defaults to 0.1 (10\% error).}

\item{trace}{Logical: should progress bars and messages be printed to the console? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{type}{The type of norm to use in determining distance between true and approximate K. Defaults to 'F', for Frobenious norm. See Matrix::norm() for details.}

\item{returnKapprox}{Logical: in addition to the list of SVD components for approximated K, should the approximation be returned as a matrix? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{returnK}{Logical: should the true K (as in relatedness_mat(X)) be returned? Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list with at least 3 items:
\itemize{
\item eigs_K: a list with the eigenvalues \code{s} and eigenvectors \code{U} for the approximated variance matrix \code{Sigma} that can be passed to \code{plmm()}
\item k, the chosen number of eigenvalues
\item delt, the distance between the true and approximated K matrices at chosen k
\item k_vals, a vector of all k values evaluated
\item inv_delt_vals, a vector of 1-delta at all k values evaluated. See \code{delta()} for details.
\item optional: if returnKapprox, K_approx will be returned
\item optional: if returnK, K will be returned
