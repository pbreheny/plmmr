\arguments{
\item{prep}{A list as returned from \code{plmm_prep}}

\item{y}{The original (not centered) outcome vector. Need this for intercept estimate}

\item{std_X_details}{A list with components 'center' (values used to center X), 'scale' (values used to scale X), and 'ns' (indices for nonsingular columns of X)}

\item{penalty_factor}{A multiplicative factor for the penalty applied to each coefficient. If supplied, penalty_factor must be a numeric vector of length equal to the number of columns of X. The purpose of penalty_factor is to apply differential penalization if some coefficients are thought to be more likely than others to be in the model. In particular, penalty_factor can be 0, in which case the coefficient is always in the model without shrinkage.}

\item{fbm_flag}{Logical: is std_X an FBM object? Passed from \code{plmm()}.}

\item{penalty}{The penalty to be applied to the model. Either "MCP" (the default), "SCAD", or "lasso".}

\item{gamma}{The tuning parameter of the MCP/SCAD penalty (see details). Default is 3 for MCP and 3.7 for SCAD.}

\item{alpha}{Tuning parameter for the Mnet estimator which controls the relative contributions from the MCP/SCAD penalty and the ridge, or L2 penalty. alpha=1 is equivalent to MCP/SCAD penalty, while alpha=0 would be equivalent to ridge regression. However, alpha=0 is not supported; alpha may be arbitrarily small, but not exactly 0.}

\item{lambda_min}{The smallest value for lambda, as a fraction of lambda.max. Default is .001 if the number of observations is larger than the number of covariates and .05 otherwise.}

\item{nlambda}{Length of the sequence of lambda. Default is 100.}

\item{lambda}{A user-specified sequence of lambda values. By default, a sequence of values of length nlambda is computed, equally spaced on the log scale.}

\item{eps}{Convergence threshold. The algorithm iterates until the RMSD for the change in linear predictors for each coefficient is less than eps. Default is \code{1e-4}.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations (total across entire path). Default is 10000.}

\item{init}{Initial values for coefficients. Default is 0 for all columns of X.}

\item{warn}{Return warning messages for failures to converge and model saturation? Default is TRUE.}

\item{restandardize}{Should the X matrix be restandardized after rotation? Default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments that can be passed to \code{biglasso::biglasso_simple_path()}}
