create_design_filebacked(
  data_file,
  rds_dir,
  obj,
  new_file,
  feature_id = NULL,
  add_outcome,
  outcome_id,
  outcome_col,

}
\arguments{
\item{data_file}{A filepath to rds file of processed data (data from \code{process_plink()}, \code{process_delim()}, or \code{process_matrix()})}

\item{rds_dir}{The path to the directory in which you want to create the new '.rds' and '.bk' files.}

\item{obj}{The RDS object read in by \code{create_design()}}

\item{new_file}{User-specified filename (\emph{without .bk/.rds extension}) for the to-be-created .rds/.bk files. Must be different from any existing .rds/.bk files in the same folder.}

\item{feature_id}{A string specifying the column in the data X (the feature data) with the row IDs (e.g., identifiers for each row/sample/participant/, etc.). No duplicates allowed.
- for PLINK data: a string specifying an ID column of the PLINK \code{.fam} file. Options are "IID" (default) and "FID"
- for all other filebacked data: a character vector of unique identifiers (IDs) for each row of the feature data (i.e., the data processed with \code{process_delim()})
- if left NULL (default), X is assumed to have the same row-order as add_outcome.
\strong{Note}: if this assumption is made in error, calculations downstream will be incorrect. Pay close attention here.}

\item{add_outcome}{A data frame or matrix with two columns: and ID column and a column with the outcome value (to be used as 'y' in the final design). IDs must be characters, outcome must be numeric.}

\item{outcome_id}{A string specifying the name of the ID column in 'add_outcome'}

\item{outcome_col}{A string specifying the name of the phenotype column in 'add_outcome'}

\item{na_outcome_vals}{A vector of numeric values used to code NA values in the outcome. Defaults to \code{c(-9, NA_integer)} (the -9 matches PLINK conventions).}

\item{add_predictor}{Optional: a matrix or data frame to be used for adding additional covariates/predictors/features from an external file (i.e., not a PLINK file).
This matrix must have one column that is an ID column; all other columns aside the ID will be used as covariates in the design matrix. Columns must be named.}

\item{predictor_id}{Optional: A string specifying the name of the column in 'add_predictor' with sample IDs. Required if 'add_predictor' is supplied.
The names will be used to subset and align this external covariate with the supplied PLINK data.}

\item{logfile}{Optional: name of the '.log' file to be written -- \strong{Note:} do not append a \code{.log} to the filename; this is done automatically.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical: should existing .rds files be overwritten? Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{quiet}{Logical: should messages to be printed to the console be silenced? Defaults to FALSE}
