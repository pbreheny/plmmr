\title{Coef method for "plmm" class}
\usage{
\method{coef}{plmm}(object, lambda, which = seq_along(object$lambda), drop = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class "plmm."}

\item{lambda}{A numeric vector of lambda values.}

\item{which}{Vector of lambda indices for which coefficients to return.}

\item{drop}{Logical.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
}
\value{
Either a numeric matrix (if model was fit on data stored in memory)
or a sparse matrix (if model was fit on data stored filebacked). Rownames are
feature names, columns are values of \code{lambda}.
